Please use the form below, email <a href="mailto:rkalla@gmail.com">rkalla@gmail.com</a>, post on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/universal-binary-json">Google Group</a> or file an issue on <a href="https://github.com/ubjson/universal-binary-json">GitHub</a>! I really would like to get any comments, questions or feedback on the specification you think is important to share. UBJSON will only be successful through the passion of many.

If you are using the Universal Binary JSON format in an application we'd love to hear about it or if you wrote <a href="http://ubjson.org/libraries/">a library</a> to add support for it to your favorite language please let us know and we'll add it to the site!
